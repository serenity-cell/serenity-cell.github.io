        <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
        
        <p class="header"> now, I have a good amount of hobbies that I spend my time on whenever I got time for them, so lets start with the one some of yall probably know me most for.</p>
        <h1>Photography</h1>
        <div class = "img_text_container">
            <img src="images/IMG_1223.webp" alt="photo of a beautiful classic car" class="img_left">
            <p class="img_p_left">this is the hobby I am most known for since most everyone I know and even some of you guys know that I do photography. Although, its the most known hobby of my life, its not one I do often (I literally post once every couple months), yet I still love photography even if my camera gets neglected somewhat often.  </p>
        </div>
        <h1>Coding</h2>
        <div class = "img_text_container_r">
            <img src="images/IMG_3555.webp" alt="personal photo of electronic project" class="img_right">
            <p class="img_p_right">Now, coding is something I spend my time on the most. I enjoy writing and learning code and I want to at some point get in a field that has something to do with code. I try to make myself versatile and the best way I can think of doing that is to learn the basics, uses those basics with a quick, but challenging project, and move on to the next code language. currently (as of december 8, 2025) I only know Python, html and css (and for my fellow programmers, yes im counting html/css as a language I dont care). Fun fact: the picture is the html code of this very website right before I wrote this paragraph</p>
