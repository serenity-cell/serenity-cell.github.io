        <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
        <p class= main_p>So as I mentioned before, I do photography as a hobby, and I love taking pictures of anything that catches my eye. 
            Here are some of my favorite shots that I've taken over the years:</p>
        
        <div class="gallery">
            <img src="images/hobby1.webp" alt="A beautiful sunset over the mountains" class="gallery_img">
            <img src="images/hobby2.webp" alt="A close-up of a colorful flower" class="gallery_img">
            <img src="images/hobby3.webp" alt="A city skyline at night" class="gallery_img">
        </div>
        
        <p class= main_p>In addition to photography, I also enjoy hiking and exploring the outdoors. There's something about being in nature that really inspires me and helps me recharge.</p>
