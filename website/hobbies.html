        <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
        <p class= main_p>Hey there my beautiful people (or well pretty much just you). As you might know I do a bit of photography and thats not much, so I made this just to let more people know more about me! 
            (cant stay the mysterious nonchalant guy I am and always have been right?)</p>
        <p class= main_p>So yeah, I do photography as a hobby and I love taking pictures of anything that catches my eye, but thats not all I do (crazy right?!?!?!). 
            I also do coding and hobbyist electronics (I say this, but I enter a despair cycle when I forget how to code half the time).
            Now, what does that ential, you ask my dear watson? well, it just means that I can make something and yet never know why it actually starts working</p>

        <p class= main_p>In addition to photography, I also enjoy hiking and exploring the outdoors. There's something about being in nature that really inspires me and helps me recharge.</p>
