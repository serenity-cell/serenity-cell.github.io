            to me that is)</p>
        <p class= "main_p" >Outside of school, I spend my time writting code, watching anime (I genuenly need recommedations), listening to music, or going to take pictures so I can finally post once every blue moon. I have a 'totally' healthy balance of academics, programming, photography, and anything else that is misfortunate enough to catch my interest.<p>
