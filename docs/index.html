        <p class= "main_p slide-in" id="index_p">Hey there, my name is <u>Justin</u> &#128075 , I am based in the alligator-fighting state known as Florida, and welcome to my little <u>digital garden</u>. I am a very curious person who somehow always manages to find the path of most resistance and takes it anyways. </p>
        <p class= "main_p slide-in" id="index_p">Outside of school, I spend my time <em>writing code</em>, <em>watching anime</em> (I genuinely need recommendations), listening to music, or going out to take pictures so I can finally post once every blue moon. I have a <em>'TOTALLY'</em> healthy balance of academics, programming, photography, and anything else that is unfortunate enough to catch my interest.<p>        <h1 class="slide-in"> My cup of coffee</h1>
        <p class= "main_p slide-in" id="index_p">I mainly enjoy the process of making small creation projects that I can use to learn new skills or just to have fun. I enjoy the process of learning new things and instantly applying them by starting a new project. now i wont go too much into detail about the things I do (I mean thats the whole reason theres a hobby section right?), but I will say I enjoy everything I do with a passion even though it means I spend more time on one thing than the other because of my horrible time management skills lol</p>
