        <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio...thing?? lol</h1>
        <p class= "header" >This is a brief introduction about myself</p>

        <p class= "main_p" >Hey there, my name is Justin and I am based in the alligator-fighting state known as Florida, I am a very curious person who somehow always manages to find the path of most resistance and takes it anyways. I have multiple hobbies, mainly building things for fun(and sometimes they are useful, 
            to me that is)</p>
        <p class= "main_p" >Outside of school, I spend my time writting code, watching anime (I geniuenly need recommedations), listening to music, or going out to take pictures so I can finally post once every blue moon. I have a 'TOTALLY' healthy balance of academics, programming, photography, and anything else that is misfortunate enough to catch my interest.<p>
        <p class= "main_p" >As for what I am currently doing? I am learning web dev (which is actually the progress youre seeing right now!). Its an interesting and fascinating learning journey and I really hope the website doesnt look that bland or has weird color mixtures(hopefully, because im getting my color palette off of pinterest LOL) </p>
        <h1> My cup of coffee</h1>
        <p class= "main_p">I mainly enjoy the process of making small creation projects that I can use to learn new skills or just to have fun. I enjoy the process of learning new things and instantly applying them by starting a new project. now i wont go too much into detail about the things I do (I mean thats the whole reason theres a hobby section right?), but I will say I enjoy everything I do with a passion even though it means I spend more time on one thing than the other because of my horrible time management skills lol</p>
