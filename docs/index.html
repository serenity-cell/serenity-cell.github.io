        <p class= "main_p slide-in" id="index_p">Hey there, my name is <u>Justin</u> 👋 , I am based in the alligator-fighting state known as Florida  🐊, and welcome to my little <u>digital garden</u> 🍃. I am a very curious person who somehow always manages to find the path of most resistance and takes it anyways. </p>
        <p class= "main_p slide-in" id="index_p">Outside of school, I spend my time <em link="">writing code</em>💻, <em>watching anime</em> (I genuinely need recommendations), <em>listening to music</em> 🎶, or going out to take pictures so I can finally post once every blue moon.</p>

        <p class= "main_p slide-in" id="index_p"> <u>Creation</u>, as I was making this website (specially the hobby page) I realized that I am mainly drawn to creation of some form. I do not know why that is, but I do know that it is somehow the top category I have in my arsenal. Besides this, I believe my greatest strength is the way I will stop at nothing to achieve the things I truly want. </p>
