                <p class="hover-text"> I love photography, but it is not something I spend my time on much which I'm sorry about because it means yall don't get to see many frequent posts. It also doesn't help that I only post things that im like "yea that looks decent enough to be posted" and its rarely good enough now lol. </p>

Small things like this website are mini projects I enjoy doing</p>

                <p class="hover-text"> Hobbyist electronics is basically just coding, but now its physical. I enjoy making little gadgets and experiments with what I have. It is a hobby I do often but not as often since it involves just buying more and more pieces for every new project I want to try out</p>
