        <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
        
        <p class="header"> now, I have a good amount of hobbies that I spend my time on whenever I got time for them, so lets start with the one some of yall probably know me most for.</p>
        <h1>Photography</h1>
        <div class = "img_text_container">
            <img src="images/IMG_1223.webp" alt="photo of a beautiful classic car" fetchpriority= "high" class="img_left">
            <p class="img_p_left">This is the hobby I am most known for since most everyone I know, and even some of you guys, know that I do photography. Although it's the most public hobby in my life, it's not one I do often (I literally post once every couple months), yet I still love photography even if my camera gets neglected somewhat often. </p>
            <p class="sub-text">right now (as of December 8, 2025), I have been trying to get a better lens than I do now, but I'm a brokie so I cant do that yet (I'm actually about to go to the streets and beg for cash)</p>
        </div>

        <h1>Coding</h1>
        <div class = "img_text_container_r">
            <img src="images/IMG_3555.webp" alt="personal photo of electronic project" class="img_right">
            <p class="img_p_right">Now, coding is something I spend my time on the most. I enjoy writing and learning code, and I want to at some point get in a field that has something to do with code. Currently (as of December 8, 2025, again), I only know Python, HTML, and CSS. Now, I want to learn either C++ or JS and Java, because why not? Fun fact: the picture is the html code of this very website right before I wrote this paragraph</p>
        </div>

        <h1>Hobbyist Electronics</h1>
        <div class = "img_text_container">
            <img src="images/IMG_3554.webp" alt="personal photo of electronic project" class="img_left">
            <p class="img_p_left">Another hobby of mine is hobbyist electronics. I enjoy building small electronic projects that are either useful or just fun to make. I normally use a Raspberry Pi Pico and an ESP32/ESP32-C3 because they seem the most fun and versatile to use. The picture is of a small project I made that is a simple temperature and humidity sensor that displays the data on an LCD screen.</p>
