                <p class="hover-text"> It is honestly really exciting when I get to try out a new area in photography for the first time. I definitely enjoy
                    that it has more action than areas like street photography. I went to a soccer game about a day ago and found it a little nerve wrecking 
                    but it went away with the time. I feel like I some decently good pictures but nothing to be completely proud of </p>

                <p class="hover-text"> I feel like the website is adequate enough (im only missing to add my links like github and socials) to allow me to start a new project. For my new project I was thinking of developing a mini plant care app going off pure python and tkinter for the UI (user interface). This is just another personal project specially for my orchids that I take care off. It definitely wont be easy since ive never attempted at even building an app, but thats the whole point. I enjoy the challenge and the struggle</p>

                <p class="hover-text">I feel like it is finally time to post my website. I've been working on it for basically a month, and I believe it's pretty much complete apart from a couple of necessary adjustments, but that's only in the polishing stage. Learning how to do it as I was doing it was probably both the dumbest and smartest thing I could've done, because I got to make a website without being in tutorial hell, but at the same time I had no idea what I was doing the majority of the time, so I depended on HTML/CSS documentation and AI help for the JavaScript parts.</p>

                <p class="hover-text"> The only place where I actually post is on my photography account, and even posting I rarely do. I enjoy photography, but I always spend my time on either academics or coding projects, and I'm thinking that I should try to take more initiative towards actually posting or find other things to post about. Personally, I started the account with hopes of developing it into a small hustle, but now I view it as more of a place where I can just post little things and small pieces of my hobby with the world.  </p>
